## Center for Washington Area Studies 
Across the Capital Region, there is growing concern about housing affordability.  Between 2010 and 2017, the region added almost twice as many people as housing units.  This dwindling housing supply relative to population is a substantial concern for the economic vitality of the region.

With the second annual State of the Capital Region report from the George Washington University’s Center for Washington Area Studies, we seek to understand the shifting housing landscape in communities throughout the area and, in doing so, improve the lives of people living in the Capital Region. Our second report focuses on housing; in future years we expect to look at other issues, including transportation, zoning and gentrification.  

This year’s topic stems from our concern for the region’s economic vitality. Increasing the number of homes available for sale or to rent is the most straightforward way to limit home price appreciation and increase housing affordability. Thus, we examine the amount and location of new housing in the Capital Region.
